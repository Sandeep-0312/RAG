Climate Change: Understanding Our Changing Planet

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate has varied naturally throughout Earth's history, human activities have accelerated these changes dramatically since the Industrial Revolution.

Greenhouse Gases trap heat in Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are the primary culprits. CO2 levels have increased by over 40% since pre-industrial times, primarily due to burning fossil fuels for energy.

Rising Global Temperatures have increased by approximately 1.1°C since the late 1800s. This may seem small, but it's causing significant impacts worldwide. The last decade was the warmest on record.

Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels are direct consequences of warming. Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13% per decade. Glaciers worldwide are retreating. Sea levels have risen about 8-9 inches since 1880 and are accelerating.

Extreme Weather Events are becoming more frequent and intense. Heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, and flooding are all influenced by climate change. These events threaten lives, infrastructure, and food security.

Ocean Acidification occurs as oceans absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. This makes water more acidic, threatening marine life, especially organisms with calcium carbonate shells like corals and shellfish.

Renewable Energy Solutions include solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. These technologies have become increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. Transitioning to clean energy is crucial for reducing emissions.

Individual Actions Matter Too. Reducing energy consumption, choosing sustainable transportation, eating less meat, and reducing waste all contribute. Collective individual choices can drive significant change alongside policy reforms.
